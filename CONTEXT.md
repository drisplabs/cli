# drisp/cli

Workflow runtime for AI coding harnesses (Claude Code, Codex). Intercepts harness hook events, normalizes them, persists them, and renders them in a terminal UI.

## Language

### Pipeline

**RuntimeEvent**:
A normalized harness event (one of ~30 kinds: `tool.pre`, `session.start`, `permission.request`, etc.) emitted by a harness adapter.
_Avoid_: hook event, raw event, protocol event.

**RuntimeDecision**:
A delayed answer from the user/controller that resolves a prior `RuntimeEvent` (e.g. permission grant). Correlated by `request_id`.

**FeedEvent**:
A timeline-ready event derived from one or more `RuntimeEvent`s. Carries `event_id`, `seq`, `run_id`, `session_id`, `actor_id`, `kind`, `data`.
_Avoid_: feed item (that's a UI projection of multiple `FeedEvent`s).

**FeedMapper**:
The module that converts `RuntimeEvent` → `FeedEvent[]` and `RuntimeDecision` → `FeedEvent`. Stateful: maintains run/session/actor/correlation state across the event stream. Bootstraps from stored events on resume.

**Runtime event loop**:
The non-React assembly that subscribes to a `Runtime`'s `RuntimeEvent` / `RuntimeDecision` streams, drives each through the **FeedMapper** ingest, feeds any controller-derived `RuntimeDecision` back to the runtime via `sendDecision` **before** handing the resulting `FeedEvent`s to a mode-specific sink. One owner (`attachRuntimeEventLoop`) shared by interactive (`useFeed`) and headless (`runExec`) so the subscribe → ingest → decide → publish assembly cannot drift; each mode injects only its own side effects (perf tracing + React store pushes, or JSONL + final-message tracking). See `docs/adr/0005-one-runtime-event-loop.md`.
_Avoid_: event handler, runtime subscription (names one listener, not the assembly).

**Dashboard decision drain**:
The interval loop that forwards pending dashboard `RuntimeDecision`s from the local decision inbox into the `Runtime` (`sendDecision` + `markConsumed`), one batch (`limit` 25) per pass. Shared by both modes via `startDashboardDecisionDrain`; each caller owns only _when_ the drain starts.
_Avoid_: decision poller (cadence is one detail, not the concept), inbox loop.

### State inside the FeedMapper

The mapper is internally composed of six named seams; each owns one slice of the mapper's state and has its own test surface.

**RunLifecycle**:
Owns `currentSession`, `currentRun`, run/session sequence numbers, and per-run counters (tool uses, failures, permission requests, blocks). Decides when a run starts, ends, or rolls over.
_Avoid_: run state, session manager.

**ToolCorrelation**:
Owns the `tool_use_id → feed event_id` index, streamed-output accumulators, and truncation state. Knows how a `tool.pre` enables a later `tool.post`/`tool.failure`/`tool.delta`, and how to handle a missing pre.

**DecisionCorrelation**:
Owns the `request_id → event_id` indexes that let `mapDecision` find the originating event. Has explicit invariants about restore behavior (fresh runs clear indexes; old `request_id`s never recur).
_Avoid_: request index, decision router.

**AgentMessageStream**:
Owns pending message buffers, dedup state per actor scope, and reasoning summary accumulation. Decides when an in-flight message is emittable.

**RootPlanTracker**:
Owns the **Root plan** — the canonical task list surfaced via `FeedMapper.getTasks()`. Knows how to compare a proposed plan against the current one (`differs`) and how to replace it (`set`). Updated from `session.start` bootstrap, `plan.delta`, and `tool.pre` for `TodoWrite`.
_Avoid_: task store, plan state.

**SubagentTracker**:
Owns the **Subagent stack** (LIFO of active subagent actor IDs), the **Pending description** handoff, and the per-agent description registry. Caller-prefixes actor IDs (`subagent:<id>`) — the tracker treats them as opaque strings.
_Avoid_: agent stack, subagent state.

### Identity

**Attachment**:
The binding between a paired CLI instance and one dashboard-side **runner**.
Owned by the dashboard (the CLI never creates or deletes one — it only
mirrors). Surfaced locally in `~/.config/athena/attachments.json`. Each
Attachment may receive dashboard assignments through the dashboard runtime
daemon and console traffic through a gateway sidecar. The Attachment does not
own a local harness process; dashboard assignment execution is owned by the
dashboard runtime daemon. See `docs/adr/0001-attachment-supervisor.md`.
_Avoid_: pairing (overloaded with the auth handshake), runner binding (verb
phrase, not a noun for the resulting state).

**Dashboard assignment**:
A dashboard-issued request for the paired runtime daemon to execute one
dashboard **Run** on behalf of a **runner**.
_Avoid_: job assignment (wire-frame name), remote assignment (describes one
transport path, not the domain concept).

**Dashboard connection context**:
The dashboard URL and instance id captured from the live dashboard socket
connection. Used by the dashboard runtime daemon to admit buffered **Dashboard
assignments** against the same connected dashboard that made the **Attachment**
mirror current.
_Avoid_: connection state (too broad), socket context (transport detail).

**Run**:
One agent invocation within a **Session**. Triggered by `session.start` or `user.prompt`. Has a status (`running` | `completed`), counters, and an actor tree.

**Session**:
A drisp instance lifecycle. Spans many **Runs**. Identified by an adapter session id from the harness.

**Actor**:
A participant in a **Run** — the root agent or a subagent. Subagents form a stack (LIFO).

**Subagent**:
A child agent spawned by the root agent via the `Task` (or `Agent`) tool. Pushed onto the **Subagent stack** at `subagent.start`, removed at `subagent.stop`. Tracked by **SubagentTracker** for the duration of its lifecycle.

**Root plan**:
The canonical task list for the current session, sourced from `TodoWrite` tool inputs or `plan.delta` events and surfaced publicly via `FeedMapper.getTasks()`. Owned by **RootPlanTracker**. Survives across **Runs** within a **Session**.
_Avoid_: tasks (too generic), todo list (used in tool input but not as a domain term inside core/).

**Pending description**:
A description string captured from a subagent-spawning tool's input (`tool.pre` for `Task`/`Agent`) and consumed by the next `subagent.start` to populate the event payload and description registry. Single-slot buffer, cleared on consume or on a subsequent subagent `tool.pre` without a description.

### Gateway

**Dispatch turn**:
One inbound channel message routed to the **Registered runtime** and whose reply is routed back. Identified by a `dispatchId` minted on entry and resolved on `session.turn.complete`. Durable on both sides — parked in the **inbound queue** if no runtime is bound, parked in the **outbox** if the channel send fails.
_Avoid_: turn (overloaded with the FeedMapper "run"), dispatch (verb only).

**Registered runtime**:
The single Athena runtime currently bound to the gateway. Owns a `defaultAgentId`, a connection, a binding state (`active` | `stale` | absent), and a push handle the gateway uses to deliver `session.dispatch.turn` frames. Single-runtime in v1 — multi-runtime is a future change.

**DispatchPipeline**:
The gateway module that owns the **Dispatch turn** end-to-end. Wraps the binding store, the inbound queue, the outbox + drain loop, and the runtime push handle behind one interface. Owns the stale-binding grace timer and emits observer notifications for telemetry and external dispose.
_Avoid_: dispatcher (the historical class is now an internal collaborator), message pipeline (too generic).

**Relay**:
The round-trip that resolves a **RuntimeEvent** requiring user input (a `permission.request`, a question) by sending it out to the paired dashboard channel via the session bridge and feeding the answer back as a **RuntimeDecision**. CLI→channel→CLI — the interactive inverse of a **Dispatch turn** (channel→CLI→channel). The same relay wiring serves both interactive (Ink) and headless (exec) modes, so neither mode owns it.
_Avoid_: relay adapter (the module, not the concept), permission proxy.

### Marketplace cache

**Marketplace cache**:
The local clone of a remote `owner/repo` marketplace under
`marketplaceRepoCacheDir`. Two **cache policies** operate on it, both owned by
`marketplaceRefresh`.
_Avoid_: marketplace repo (ambiguous with the remote), cache dir (the path, not
the concept).

**Ensure** _(cache policy)_:
Clone-if-missing. Used on the read/resolve path — plugin and workflow
resolution, on every harness launch. Clones only when the cache is absent;
**never pulls**. Returns the cache directory, throws a classified
`MarketplaceRefreshError` when the clone fails.
_Avoid_: load, sync (sync implies a pull).

**Refresh** _(cache policy)_:
Pull-then-self-heal. Used only on an explicit `workflow upgrade`.
Fast-forward pulls; on a dirty/divergent/corrupt cache, self-heals via
backup-then-reclone. Returns a classified outcome, **never throws**.

**Refresh failure kind**:
Every cache clone or pull failure is classified `network-or-auth` (remote
unreachable or auth rejected) or `unrecoverable-cache` (local cache could not be
rebuilt), so callers render a marketplace-named cause instead of raw git output.
Shared by both cache policies; the user-facing wording is not (Ensure says
"reach", Refresh says "refresh").

## Relationships

- A **Session** contains many **Runs**.
- A **Run** is owned by one root **Actor**, which may spawn subagent **Actors**.
- A **RuntimeEvent** is mapped to zero or more **FeedEvent**s by the **FeedMapper**.
- A **RuntimeDecision** is mapped to one **FeedEvent** by the **FeedMapper**, correlated through **DecisionCorrelation**.
- The **FeedMapper** is composed of **RunLifecycle**, **ToolCorrelation**, **DecisionCorrelation**, **AgentMessageStream**, **RootPlanTracker**, and **SubagentTracker** as internal seams. Their combined interface is the seven-method `FeedMapper` type.
- The **Pending description** flows from `tool.pre` (Task/Agent) to the next `subagent.start`, where **SubagentTracker** consumes and clears it.
- The **Root plan** persists across **Runs** within a **Session** — only per-run state (subagent stack, tool/decision correlation, message stream) is reset between runs.
- A **Dispatch turn** is created by the **DispatchPipeline** when an inbound channel message arrives with a **Registered runtime** bound; resolved on the matching `session.turn.complete`.
- The **DispatchPipeline** owns the **Registered runtime** binding state — `Run`/`Session` (the FeedMapper concepts) live one layer up and are unrelated to the gateway-side runtime registration.
- A **Relay** is initiated by whichever mode is running (interactive or exec); both modes share one relay wiring, so a relay is a CLI-initiated inverse of a channel-initiated **Dispatch turn**.
- The **Runtime event loop** is the single owner of the subscribe → ingest → `sendDecision` → publish assembly for both interactive and headless modes; each mode is a thin adapter that supplies only its own side effects. The **Dashboard decision drain** is a sibling helper both modes reuse to feed inbound dashboard `RuntimeDecision`s into the same runtime.
- A **Dashboard assignment** is admitted by the dashboard runtime daemon before
  it launches the corresponding dashboard **Run** locally.
- A **Dashboard connection context** exists only while the dashboard socket is
  connected; buffered **Dashboard assignments** are admitted only after the
  context is available.
- The **Ensure** and **Refresh** cache policies both operate on one
  **Marketplace cache** and share one **Refresh failure kind** classifier; they
  differ only in whether they pull, whether they self-heal, and whether they
  throw or return an outcome.

## Relationship to workflow-execution language

This document owns the **feed-pipeline** bounded context (observation / projection, owned by the **FeedMapper**). A second bounded context, **workflow-execution** (execution / control, owned by the Runner), is documented in `UBIQUITOUS_LANGUAGE.md`. The two collide only on the bare English words _session_, _run_, and _turn_ — they are kept **separate and qualified**, never merged (see `docs/adr/0003-execution-unit-terminology.md`).

Cross-walk of the colliding words:

| Bare word | Feed-pipeline meaning (this doc)                    | Workflow-execution meaning (`UBIQUITOUS_LANGUAGE.md`)                                        | Persistence reality                             |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| session   | FeedMapper **Session** (drisp instance lifecycle)   | **Athena Session** (durable container) or **Agent Session** (per-Turn vendor session/thread) | `session` table                                 |
| run       | **Run** / **Feed Run** (trigger-bounded projection) | **Workflow Run** (one loop execution)                                                        | `feed_events.run_id` ≠ `workflow_runs.id`       |
| turn      | **Dispatch turn** (`dispatchId`)                    | **Turn** (`startTurn`)                                                                       | `gateway_function_invocations` vs no Turn table |

Legacy DB-name mapping (the persisted identifiers keep their original names; this mapping explains them rather than renaming them — see ADR 0003):

| Persisted identifier | Domain concept                                                         |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `session` table      | **Athena Session** (durable work-unit)                                 |
| `workflow_runs`      | **Workflow Run** (loop execution; many per Athena Session)             |
| `feed_events.run_id` | **Feed Run** (this doc's projection) — unrelated to `workflow_runs.id` |
| `adapter_sessions`   | **Agent Session** (the per-Turn vendor session/thread)                 |

## Example dialogue

> **Dev:** "When a `tool.post` arrives but `ToolCorrelation` has no matching pre, what does the **FeedMapper** emit?"
> **Domain expert:** "It emits a `tool.post` **FeedEvent** with a `cause` of `orphan`, because the missing-pre case is handled inside **ToolCorrelation** — the **FeedMapper** itself doesn't know what 'orphan' means."

## Flagged ambiguities

- "event" alone is ambiguous between **RuntimeEvent** and **FeedEvent** — always qualify.
- "session" alone is ambiguous between drisp **Session** and harness adapter session — say "adapter session" for the latter. It also collides with the workflow-execution **Athena Session** / **Agent Session** (see the cross-walk above).
- "run" alone is ambiguous between the FeedMapper **Run** (this doc) and the workflow-execution **Workflow Run** (`UBIQUITOUS_LANGUAGE.md`) — `feed_events.run_id` is unrelated to `workflow_runs.id`. Qualify as **Feed Run** vs **Workflow Run**.
- "task" is overloaded by the protocol: `TodoWrite` tool inputs use it for plan items, while the `Task` tool spawns **Subagents**. Inside core/, say **plan step** for the former and **Subagent** for the latter — never bare "task."
